% Mean square displacement (MSD) analysis is a technique commonly used in
% colloidal studies and biophysics to determine what is the mode of
% displacement of particles followed over time. In particular, it can help
% determine whether the particle is:
%
% * freely diffusing;
% * transported;
% * bound and limited in its movement.
%
% On top of this, it can also derive an estimate of the parameters of the
% movement, such as the diffusion coefficient. 
%
% |@msdanalyzer| is a MATLAB per-value class that helps performing this
% kind of analysis. The user provides several trajectories he measured, and
% the class can derive meaningful quantities for the determination of the
% movement modality, assuming that all particles follow the same movement
% model and sample the same environment.
%
% This tutorial doubles the documentation of the class, that can be

%% Brownian motion and mean square displacement.
% 
% According to Einstein theory (the first part), an ensemble of particles
% undergoing brownian motion will have the following density:
% 
% $$ \rho(r,t) = \frac{\rho_0}{\sqrt{4\pi Dt}} e^{-\frac{r^2}{4Dt}} $$
% 
% assuming all the particles where followed from a single point at |t=0|,
% that |r| is the distance to this point, and |D| the diffusion
% coefficient. This (and much more) can be found in Einstein historical
% paper [1].
% 
% Using this formula, one can derive the mean square displacement for such
% particles:
%
%
% $$ < r^2 > = 2 d D t $$
%
% where |d| is the dimensionality of the problem (2 for 2D, etc...) and |D|
% the diffusion coefficient. The mean is taken over a whole ensemble of
% particles: you have to sample many particles, compute
% $\textrm{msd}_i(\tau) = (r_i(\tau)-r_{i}(0))^2$ for each particle |i| and
% average the resulting |msd_i| over all particles.
%
% We see that the plot of the MSD value as a function of time should be a
% straight line in the case of diffusing movement. We therefore have a way
% to check what is the modality of the particle movement. If the MSD is a
% line, then it is diffusing, and the slope gives us the diffusion
% coefficient. If the MSD saturates and has a concave curvature, then its
% movement is impeded: it cannot freely diffuse away from its starting
% point. On the contrary, if the MSD increases faster than at linear rate,
% then it must be transported, because Brownian motion could not take it
% away that fast.
%
% This is great, because to decide whether the erratic movement of a
% particle that you are observing is freely diffusive, bound, or
% transported, you would have to follow the particle for an infinite
% amount of time. This formula gives you a function that can be evaluated
% to check whether the particle movement is of any type. So we just need a
% way to evaluate it practically.
% 
% Experimentally, the MSD for a single particle is also taken as a mean. If
% the process is stationary (that is: the "situation", experimental
% conditions, etc...  do not change over time), the ensemble average can be
% taken as a time average for a single trajectory, and |msd| for a single
% particle can be calculated as
%
% $$\textrm{msd}_i(\tau) = \sum_t (r_i(t+\tau) - r_i(t) )^2$$
%
% $\tau$ is called the delay; the MSD tells you how far can a particle
% under Brownian motion can go over a time $\tau$ . For finite
% trajectories, obviously the smaller delays $\tau$  will be more
% represented in the average than longer delays. For instance, if a
% trajectory has |N| points in it, the delay corresponding to one frame
% will have |N-1| points in the average, and the delay corresponding to |N|
% frames will only have one. This has major consequences on measurement
% certainty, see [2].

%% |@msdanalyzer|: a MATLAB per-value class for MSD analysis.
% 
% The class presented here perform these computations automatically, and

% trajectories. 
%
% The user must provide the class with particle trajectories, possibly
% several thousands of them. The class itself cannot generate those
% trajectories. For this, you want to check single-particle tracking tools.
% Here are a few examples, drawn from Life-Sciences and my work:
%
% * <http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Fiji> ships a tracking tool
% named <http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/TrackMate TrackMate> made by yours
% truly, that can deal rather well with Brownian motion. The software is a

% * <http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/ Icy> is another Java
% software dedicated to Life Science that also offers
% <http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/plugin/Probabilistic_particle_tracker a

% * If you already have the positions of all particles, and just need to
% link them to build tracks, you can use in MATLAB the
% <http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34040-simple-tracker
% simple tracker> tool, again made by yours truly. But it has a much
% simpler capability compared that the two others.
%
% And there are most likely plenty of other solutions out there.
%
% |@msdanalyzer| can deal with tracks (particle trajectories) that do not

%
% and will get a page where all methods and fields are detailed.
