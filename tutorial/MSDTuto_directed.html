% You would like to know whether it is actively transported, _e.g._ by

%% MSD analysis.
%
% Let's see how the simulated trajectories look like:

ma = msdanalyzer(2, SPACE_UNITS, TIME_UNITS);
ma = ma.addAll(tracks);
ma.plotTracks
ma.labelPlotTracks

%%
% The transported behavior is rather obvious, even on this short time. Here
% is what the average MSD curve look like:

ma = ma.computeMSD;
figure
ma.plotMeanMSD(gca, true);

%%
% Obviously, the MSD curve does not look like a straight line anymore. It
% has a clear positive curvature, indicating that the excursion of the
% particle at long times exceed what it should be if it was purely
% diffusive.
%
% Its analytical expression is detailed in Saxton paper [3]:
%
% $$ < r^2 > = 2 d D t + v^2 t^2 $$
% 
% so we should expect to see a parabola, with the directed motion
% behavior dominating for large delays. A fit of the average MSD curve by a
% polynomial |msd = a x t + c x t²| should therefore yield both the
% diffusion coefficient and the flow velocity. There is not automated
% method to do it in |@msdanalyzer|; we'll have to do it "by hand":

A = ma.getMeanMSD;
t = A(:, 1); % delay vector
msd = A(:,2); % msd
std_msd = A(:,3); % we will use inverse of the std as weights for the fit
std_msd(1) = std_msd(2); % avoid infinity weight

ft = fittype('a*x + c*x^2');
[fo, gof] = fit(t, msd, ft, 'Weights', 1./std_msd, 'StartPoint', [0 0]);

hold on
plot(fo)
legend off
ma.labelPlotMSD

Dfit = fo.a / 4;
Vfit = sqrt(fo.c);

ci = confint(fo);
Dci = ci(:,1) / 4;
Vci = sqrt(ci(:,2));

fprintf('Parabolic fit of the average MSD curve with 95%% confidence interval:\n')

fprintf('D = %.3g [ %.3g - %.3g ] %s, real value was %.3g %s\n', ...
    Dfit, Dci(1), Dci(2), [SPACE_UNITS '²/' TIME_UNITS], D, [SPACE_UNITS '²/' TIME_UNITS]);

fprintf('V = %.3g [ %.3g - %.3g ] %s, real value was %.3g %s\n', ...
    Vfit, Vci(1), Vci(2), [SPACE_UNITS '/' TIME_UNITS], vm, [SPACE_UNITS '/' TIME_UNITS]);

%%
% So the numerical estimates are reasonably good, regarding the low number
% of particles we have. For actual experiments, the situation might be less
% ideal. For large delays, the uncertainty might be so high that it will
% alter the values deduced from the fit. You might then want to limit the
% fit to only a portion of the average MSD curve, like we did before. But
% then, we have now a fit with two free variables (|D| and |v|), so it
% requires more data points to be robust. And anyway, if you want to have a
% good confidence on the transport mechanism, you want to sample the
% movement over long time. 
%
% As if these considerations were not enough, there is localization error
% that will change the fit function. As discussed later in this tutorial,
% such errors induce an offset of the average MSD curve, that you need to
% take into account in the fit. This adds another free variable,
% compromising the robustness of the fit even more.


%% Velocity auto-correlation.
%
% Another way to discard the possibility a purely Brownian motion is to
% check the velocity auto-correlation:

ma = ma.computeVCorr;
figure
ma.plotMeanVCorr

%%
% Note that the auto-correlation seems to be above 0. This shows that on
% average, a displacement has more chance to be in the same direction over
% time.
%
% Qian _et al._ [2] (equations 10 & 11) mention that one could derive the
% direction motion velocity out the velocity analysis. However it fails in
% our case since each particle have a different motion vector: Their
% directed motion have the same mean speed, but not the same direction. So
% far, the fit of the MSD curve is the only way to derive the direction
% motion speed.
